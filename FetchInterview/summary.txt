1. Why did you choose the tools, libraries, and language you used for the coding exercise?
I chose to use Java Spring Boot for this coding exercise because I gained valuable experience with it during my internship at Kohl’s Technology in Summer 2024, where I enhanced the reliability and scalability of transaction email systems for online customers. This role familiarized me with building and maintaining REST and SOAP APIs using Spring Boot, which is helpful because it really simplifies the set-up.  Additionally, using Java aligns with my background and experience in the language.

2. What are the advantages and disadvantages of your solution?
Advantages:
Using Java Spring Boot and efficient data structures allowed for a well-structured approach towards the assignment. For example, the use of a List<Transaction> for storing transactions allows for easy tracking and retrieval in the order they were added, which is essential for maintaining transaction history. In addition, the Map<String, Integer> for point balances enables O(1) average-time complexity for balance lookups and updates, making it efficient for real-time operations. The addPoints and spendPoints methods are clearly defined, promoting readability and maintainability. Finally, sorting transactions by timestamp before spending points ensures that points are deducted in the correct order, reflecting realistic transaction behavior. 

Disadvantages: 
While the current solution does everything it's supposed to, it may lack flexibility for future enhancements, such as adding features for transaction types or detailed logging without significant refactoring. Additionally, the memory consumption of Java applications may not be ideal for environments with limited resources. Not to mention, although convenient afterwards, the initial set-up process for SpringBoot may be overkill or too extra for simpler tasks such as this one. 

3. What has been a favorite school/personal project thus far? What about it that challenged you?
This year, I am independently leading a project through the research lab I’ve been working at as part of my Honors Thesis. Building on insights from a previous project focused on multi-party interactions between parents, robots, and children, I am investigating and developing effective interface designs for a collaborative parent-child-robot reading system that utilizes ChatGPT. I am excited to be building this interface from scratch, with a primary aim to support immigrant parents who may feel anxious or insecure about their English skills, focusing on enhancing their confidence and engagement during shared reading activities with their children. I feel really passionate about the topic itself and I am eager to carry this project through the academic year and advocate for its importance. This project is particularly meaningful to me as it marks my first experience leading a research study from inception to completion, presenting both exciting challenges and valuable learning opportunities both in the technical aspects and qualitative aspects.
